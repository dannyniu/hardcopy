    This is a sample project that talks about
    elementary and middle school mathematics.
    It's meant to demonstrate some typical
    usages of the HardCopy template system, and
    is not meant to teach maths. I've drawn
    contents from examination reference books
    published by my local educational institutions,
    but I cannot fully guarantee its correctness.

    But anyway, have fun using it, and you're
    welcome to provide feedback on the GitHub page
    for the project.
