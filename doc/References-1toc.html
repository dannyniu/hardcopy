    <h3>HardCopy - Document Structuring Component</h3>

    <p>
      This document describes HardCopy's functions for
      document structuring.
    </p>

    <p>
      HardCopy is able to produce multi-page and single-page
      HTML documents with
      table of contents,
      table and figure indicies, and
      cross-reference hyperlinks.
    </p>

    <p>
      As demonstrated in the example project and in
      <a href="Tutorial.html">tutorial</a>,
      the structure of the document is defined by
      the "toc.php" file, which serves as the
      entry-point of the project.
      The build process takes this file and
      produces output in 2 phases.
    </p>

    <p>In the 1st phase:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        "toc.php" tells the build system,
        the title and optionally the cover page of the document, and
        which chapter content files to include;
      </li>
      <li>
        the chapter files
        tells the build system what chapters and sections,
        as well as what tables and figures and hyperlink references
        (hence, <i>anchors</i>) there are.
      </li>
      <li>
        The build system records the sequence of occurrences of
        <i>anchors</i>, and suppresses the output of chapter content files.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the 2nd phase:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The build system takes special code paths to produce
        cover page, table of contents and indicies, and
        auxiliary files.
      </li>
      <li>
        The build system returns the recorded occurances of
        <i>anchors</i> to the chapter files, enable their output,
        and redirect their output to build destinations.
        The <i>anchors</i> are decorated with
        section numbers, table and figure numbers, and
        anchor IDs.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Variable: <code>$Title</code></h4>

    <p>
      The main title of the document.
    </p>

    <h4>Functions <code>hc_H<i>[1-4]</i>(string $s): string</code></h4>

    <p>
      Records the section title in the 1st phase;
      returns the section with section markup in the 2nd phase.
    </p>

    <h4>Functions: <code>hc_{Table,Figure}(string $s): string</code></h4>

    <p>
      Records table and figure name in the 1st phase;
      returns anchor element in 2nd phase.
    </p>

    <h4>Function <code>hc_StartAnnexes(): void</code></h4>

    <p>
      Indicates that top level section numbering should switch to
      alphabetical ones, and that top level section headings should be
      prefixed with "Annex ".
    </p>

    <h4>Function:
      <code>hcNamedSection(string $s, $type=1): string</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Returns an hyperlink anchor to a known section.
    </p>

    <h4>Function: <code>hcPageBegin(): bool</code></h4>

    <p>
      Suppresses or enables output based on the current build phase.
    </p>

    <h4>Function: <code>hcAddPages(string $p): string</code></h4>

    <p>
      Records a page in the build system. Filename extension shall be omitted.
    </p>

    <h4>Function: <code>hcFinish(): void</code></h4>

    <p>
      Marks the end of the document.
      Does little in the 1st phase;
      produces output in the 2nd phase.
    </p>

    <h4>Function:
      <code>hcNamedAnchor(string $s, string $id): string</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Produces an anchor with ID specified in <code>$id</code> and
      text content specified in <code>$s</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Function:
      <code>hcNamedHref(string $id): string</code>
    </h4>

    <p>
      Produces a hyperlink to a named anchor produced by
      <code>hcNamedAnchor</code>.
      If the named anchor is on a different page than the link,
      the relative URL of the page is automatically added.
